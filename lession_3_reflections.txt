Adding new reflection question for lession 3

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you wouldnt want to publish a non-working version of code if it was public.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
