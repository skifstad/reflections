How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows one to choose which files get added to the Git repository 
rather than just adding everything to the git directory. This allows more
control over what files are commmitted and when.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You are able to verify the changes before they get committed. This allows the chance
to review the files changes to verify only one logical change is happening per commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

This helps seperate new versions of files that contain major new features or code
changes that you dont want to affect a working version until that feature works.
This is also a good spot for a logical change in direction for a big project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

This allows us to see how git makes commits
